### Expense Table

A basic table to preview the expense data coming from the API. I have used ag-grid as a table and react concepts to develop the tool. The idea to use the ag-grid is because of the ease and keeping future use case in mind like Search, Sort, Drag Drop, Pagination and others.

2. Code Boilerplate: To the owner of https://github.com/ruairidhflint/react-template-ts

## Developer Notes

1. Need to Add basic Unit test for the components and custom Hook
2. Need to create a interface for the API response  -  to ensure Type safety
3. The First name and last name can be placed in some secure place like using Dotenv package
